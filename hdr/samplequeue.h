// a priority queue just for sampling quickly
// It keeps track of a set of event associated with a set of variables
// will return the next event (earliest event) and can remove an event
// associated with a particular variable even if that event is not next

// Different from STL's pqueue in that we need to be able
// to remove an event from the middle of the queue without having
// to search for it.  Also, we know the total number of events to be stored
// (this could be done by storing a structure with a copy operator that
//  kept track of its position.  However, this is simpler and faster.)

// Note:  the "var" stored in an event is assume to be one of a
//  set of consecutive integers starting at 0.  Therefore, you may need
//  a map to map your varid onto this value.
