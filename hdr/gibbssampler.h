// GibbsSampler is an implementation of the paper:
// Tal El-Hay, Nir Friedman, and Raz Kupferman (2008). "Gibbs Sampling in
// Factorized Continuous-Time Markov Processes."
// This class will take in an evidence trajectory, a markov process, 
// the number of samples needed as parameters.
// It will first burn in for several iterations (number of burnin_iter is
// specified in construction function), then generate a set of sampled 
// trajectories. It is an approximate inference method used for learning 
// and inference on CTBNs.

// Sample usage:
//
// Markov ctbn;
// Trajectory evidence;
// GibbsSampler sampler(&ctbn, &evidence);
// Trajectory sample_traj;
// sampler.SampleTrajectory(sample_traj);
